Description: Analysis of imaging data collected on a regular grid using a process 
    convolution (PC) approach.  In the discrete PC approach we employ, a zero-centered 
    latent process is convolved with a smoothing kernel function in order to account for 
    spatial information.  For computational efficiency with large imaging datasets, this 
    package implements a semivariogram-based approach to estimate and fix the smoothing 
    kernel function.  In the context of a Bayesian mixed models framework, this package 
    writes and fits models to estimate the latent process at a limited set of locations 
    called support sites while also incorporating covariates of interest.  Furthermore, 
    this package incorporates the PC approach into left-censored models and marginalized 
    two-part models to account for different zero-generating processes.  This package was 
    designed for imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) data, but the methods can be extended to 
    imaging data collected over a regular grid.
